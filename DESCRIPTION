Description: Measurements related to microtiter plates, here referred to as plate data, are common in life science.
    PlateData is a S4 class to store data that can be linked to one well of a microtiter plate (e.g. A1). Unique wells
    are stored in the layout while measurements are stored in data. Contains functions that facilitate easy exploration,
    mutation, merging and subsetting.
